# DQN_Switch_v2
This is a basic Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system which I have implemented.
 This shows 2 DQNs (Deep Q Networks) which work independently (ie without any information on where the other agent is) to achieve their goal.
 This Switch_v2 (2-player) environment from ma-gym has been used here.
 
 The style of coding is such that others can view the code and read the accompanying explanation as part of a "from-the-ground-up" implementation, rather than an industry use-case.
 
 I have done a more in-depth analysis of this multi-agent DQN system, along with graphs of my actual results, over on my personal website:
