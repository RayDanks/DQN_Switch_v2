# DQN_Switch_v2
This is a basic Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system which I have implemented.
 This shows 2 DQNs (Deep Q Networks) which work independently (ie without any information on where the other agent is) to achieve their goal.
 This Switch_v2 (2-player) environment from ma-gym has been used here.
